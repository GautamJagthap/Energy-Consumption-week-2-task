# Energy-Consumption-week-2-task
For the submission of Energy Consumption and Trend Analysis Week 2 task.
By: Gautam Jagthap

As part of the Week 2 task, I developed a comprehensive dashboard that offers an overall overview of electricity, gas, and water consumption, as per the instructorâ€™s guidance. This main dashboard presents key consumption metrics and trend insights to support effective resource monitoring and decision-making.

In addition to the main dashboard, I created a dedicated page for electricity consumption analysis. This page includes:
  
  A slicer to filter data by city,
  Another slicer for selecting specific buildings,
  All data is filtered dynamically according to the selected year.

These interactive elements allow for a more focused and granular analysis of electricity usage trends across different locations and structures.
The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, informative, and supportive of energy optimization strategies.
